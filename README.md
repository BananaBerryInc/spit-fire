# A Message to our players......

We (or at least I) are back! After almost a year of radio silence, I will be refocicing on this and hopefully Beta 1 (I know, we've teased this before!) will be out soon! Please stay tuned!

# spit-fire

Spit-fire is a top down racing game that is built in Python and Pygame (and PIL) . You can race solo, with a friend, or in a drag race. There is a leveling system and hours of content in the game! Races are in a "time trial" format, with a score determining how you do! Download or fork it now!


This is our first game we ever made so it is probably not the best,but we both put a lot of time and effort into this


We hope to make more

# How to run spit-fire

Run main.py in Python 3 to start the game.


**Pygame and PIL (Python Image Library) (preferably the latest versions) are required to run the game, but if you don't have them, the Spit-fire will install them for you on first run**


If you want, you can run run_main.py.bat in the root of the repo for a quick start script.

# Releases/Updates

As of now, stable(ish) releases have no plan. This is because we are working really hard on getting Beta 1 finished, no matter how long it takes.

If you want to be on the bleeding edge, or just want an easy way to update, please check out https://github.com/BananaBerryInc/spit-fire-updater for an easy way to update Spit-fire. This is still in Beta stages, though.

We used the font "Saira", which is licensed under OFL (SIL Open Font License). You can find a copy of the font's license in the "res" directory, under the name "OFL.txt". Saira was created by Cristiano Sobral.
