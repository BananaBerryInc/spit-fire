# spit-fire

NOTE : As of build/commit 102 (or Alpha 2), PIL (Python Image Library) is required to run spit-fire!!!!


This is our first game we ever made so it is probabally not the best,but we both put alot of time and effort into this


We hope to make more

# How to run spit-fire

Run main.py in Python to start the game.
You need pygame, and PIL (Python Image Library) (preferrably the latest versions) installed to run the game.
If you want, you can run run_main.py.bat in the root of the repo for a quick start script.

# Thanks
