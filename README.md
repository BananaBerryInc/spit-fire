# spit-fire

Spit-fire is a top down racing game that is built in Python and Pygame (and PIL) . You can race solo, with a friend, or in a drag race. There is a leveling system and hours of content in the game! Races are in a "time trial" format, with a score determining how you do! Download or fork it now!


This is our first game we ever made so it is probably not the best,but we both put a lot of time and effort into this


We hope to make more

# How to run spit-fire

Run main.py in Python 3 to start the game.


**Pygame and PIL (Python Image Library) (preferably the latest versions) are required to run the game, but if you don't have them, the Spit-fire will install them for you on first run**


If you want, you can run run_main.py.bat in the root of the repo for a quick start script.

# Releases/Updates

As of now, stable(ish) releases are planned for Friday of each week. If you want to be on the bleeding edge, or just want an easy way to update, please check out https://github.com/BananaBerryInc/spit-fire-updater for an easy way to update Spit-fire. THis is still in Beta stages, though.
